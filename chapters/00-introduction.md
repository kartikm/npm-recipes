# Introduction

## Thank you!
I'm excited to share these tutorials with you! The goal of this series of tutorials is to showcase awesome modules found on [npm](http://npmjs.org).

There are over 50,000 modules on npm, so there's a wildly big number of opportunities for checking out how various npm modules can work together.

I encourage you to help guide the direction of this book! If there are particular modules that you'd like to see covered, please email me at [hi@learnjs.io](mailto:hi@learnjs.io).

This book is highly inspired by the lean publishing model ([read more about it](https://leanpub.com/manifesto)) proposed by Peter Armstrong, founder of leanpub.com. It has proven successful as a way to receive feedback from you, the readers, so that together we can make the best book about javascript tools and libraries possible.

## Tools we'll use in this book

Many of the tools used in this book are covered in detail in one of my other books, Development Environments for Beginners.

If you’re feeling like you could use more information about what a development environment is and how best to set one up, you can purchase the Development Environments book at [learnjs.io/books/dev-envs](http://learnjs.io/books/dev-envs).

If needed you can check out the Development Environments book on GitHub for free here: [github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book](http://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book).

### Sublime text editor

Sublime is a popular text editor with versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

You can download an evaluation copy for free, and pay for a license when you're ready.

In this book we'll be using version 2 of Sublime, in future updates to the book we'll switch to version 3.

### Install
Go to [sublimetext.com](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and click the download button.

### Terminal

You'll be using the terminal (or command-line) for many of the tutorials in this book. [The Terminal chapter in Development Environments for Beginners](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/manuscript/terminal.md) will help you get started.

### Node.js

We'll be using node.js mostly to get at npm, node's bundled package manager.

We will also write modules in the style of node.js.

Our code written for the browser will utilize the node.js style of modules thanks to browserify, a tool for bundling node modules for the browser.

This means that we won’t cover the RequireJS/AMD toolset for javascript development, but will focus on node/CommonJS modules whenever possible.

You’ll learn more about this later in the book as we go into depth with using Leaflet.js alongside browserify.

### npm

npm is the package manager that comes bundled with node.js. This book is all about exploring the modules available on npm. Sometimes people call it the node package manager, but I prefer a term that's becoming more popular: "node packaged modules". The idea is that we can store whatever modules we want on npm. It might be for the server or the client.

In each chapter we'll explore npm a little more, and by the end of the book you'll have learned it pretty thoroughly.

### git

I encourage you to use git as version control software to track changes as you complete tutorials. If you're new to git, learn more about it in this [Git chapter of the Development Environments book](http://git-scm.com/book), the [Try Git interactive tutorial](http://try.github.io/), and the [Pro Git book that's available for free on the git website](http://git-scm.com/book).

### GitHub & GitHub Pages

I recommend that put each map you make while reading this book up on GitHub, and if applicable, GitHub Pages. It'll be good practice if you're new to git and GitHub.

Learn more about GitHub pages in the [related chapter of the Development Environments book](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/manuscript/github.md), and on [GitHub's Help section](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles).

### Other books

There's a good chance that if you like this book you'll be interested in the other books in the Learn.js series.
